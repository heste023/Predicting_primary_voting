The two scripts in this repository are a test drive of h2o automl. One of 
the modeling recommendations in Applied Predictive Modeling (Kuhn and Johnson)
suggested intitaly building more flexible, sophisticated machine learning 
models during the modeling phase, then try to approximate the performance 
of the flexible model with a more interpretable model. Since my formal 
training is in social science and more traditional econometric methods, 
using automl is one way for me to efficiently build stacked ensemble models 
as a baseline for more interpretable models. The scripts here reflect an 
at-home run through of this approach using something that I'm familiar 
with as a social scientist, voter behavior.
